# Project 3: Guess the Number Game Python Project (user)

The "Guess the Number" game is a simple console-based Python application where the computer randomly selects a number, and the player has to guess the number within a limited number of attempts. The game provides feedback after each guess, telling the player whether the guess was too high or too low. The goal is to guess the number in as few attempts as possible.


- The computer generates a random number within a specified range (default: 1 to 100).
- The player is prompted to enter a guess.
- The program provides feedback after each guess (higher or lower).
- The player has a limited number of guesses (default: 10 attempts).
- The game ends when the player guesses the number or runs out of attempts.
- A congratulatory message is displayed if the player guesses the correct number.
